Below you will find basic setup instructions for the ``project_name``
project. To begin you should have the following applications installed on your
local development system:

- `Python >= 2.6 (2.7 recommended) <http://www.python.org/getit/>`_
- `pip >= 1.1 <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_
- `virtualenv >= 1.8 <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_

Getting Started
---------------

To setup your local environment you should create a virtualenv and install the
necessary requirements::

    virtualenv --distribute project_name-env

On Posix systems you can activate your environment like this::

    source project_name-env/bin/activate

On Windows, you'd use::

    project_name-env\Scripts\activate

Then::

    cd project_name
    pip install -r requirements/base.txt

Run syncdb::

    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate

You should now be able to run the development server::

    python manage.py runserver
